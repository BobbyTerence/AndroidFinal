# AndroidFinal
 The final project from my AndroidStudio class

## What is it?
For our final project, we were put into teams of three people, and we were tasked with creating an application of our choosing, as long as it contained the necessary requirements. <br>
I took charge of the project. I handled a good portion of the programming, along with one other person, and the thrid person in our group wrote out our Documentation, which I do not believe I have a copy of. <br>
The application we created was a simple food order app. I created the splash screen for the application, and the second person created the first screen, and he created the necessary components to pass information <br>
to different screens. I handled all of the math and displaying the final order, as well creating animations and adding sound elements to the application.

## How did I do?
I got full marks for this project
